==Things to work on==

- add typed variable whitelist diagnostic
- handle (multi-line) comments properly
- handle quoted string context
- handle multi-line macros
    - change existing diagnostics to look into the concatenated full_text
- sense usage of preprocessor-specific construct inside the macrodefinitions
  and allow them: no void/static inline suggestions
  - variadic
  - predefined expressions: __FILE__, __LINE__ etc.
- Add diagnostic to tell strange multiline macros: #include
