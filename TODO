==Things to work on==

- add typed variable whitelist diagnostic
- handle (multi-line) comments properly
- handle multi-line macros
    - add diagnostic for too long multiline continued macros
    - change existing diagnostics to look into the concatenated full_text
- sense usage of "##", "#" inside the macrodefinitions and allow them: no static inline suggestions
- Add diagnostic to tell strange multiline macros: #include
