==Things to work on==

- add typed variable whitelist diagnostic
- add __cplusplus sensing
- handle comments properly
- handle multi-line macros
- sense usage of "##", "#" inside the macrodefinitions and allow them: no static inline suggestions
- report #define X <[0x]number> as "suggest using const or enum"
